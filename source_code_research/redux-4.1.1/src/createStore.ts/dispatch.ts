   * Dispatches an action. It is the only way to trigger a state change.
   *
   * The `reducer` function, used to create the store, will be called with the
   * current state tree and the given `action`. Its return value will
   * be considered the **next** state of the tree, and the change listeners
   * will be notified.
   *
   * The base implementation only supports plain object actions. If you want to
   * dispatch a Promise, an Observable, a thunk, or something else, you need to
   * wrap your store creating function into the corresponding middleware. For
   * example, see the documentation for the `redux-thunk` package. Even the
   * middleware will eventually dispatch plain object actions using this method.
   *
   * @param action A plain object representing “what changed”. It is
   * a good idea to keep actions serializable so you can record and replay user
   * sessions, or use the time travelling `redux-devtools`. An action must have
   * a `type` property which may not be `undefined`. It is a good idea to use
   * string constants for action types.
   *
   * @returns For convenience, the same action object you dispatched.
   *
   * Note that, if you use a custom middleware, it may wrap `dispatch()` to
   * return something else (for example, a Promise you can await).
