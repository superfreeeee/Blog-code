   * You may call `dispatch()` from a change listener, with the following

   *
   * 1. The subscriptions are snapshotted just before every `dispatch()` call.
   * If you subscribe or unsubscribe while the listeners are being invoked, this
   * will not have any effect on the `dispatch()` that is currently in progress.
   * However, the next `dispatch()` call, whether nested or not, will use a more
   * recent snapshot of the subscription list.
   *
   * 2. The listener should not expect to see all state changes, as the state
   * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
   * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
   * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
   * state by the time it exits.
   *
   * @param listener A callback to be invoked on every dispatch.
   * @returns A function to remove this change listener.
