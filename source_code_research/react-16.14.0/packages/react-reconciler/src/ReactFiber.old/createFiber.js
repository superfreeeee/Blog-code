// This is a constructor function, rather than a POJO constructor, still
// please ensure we do the following:
// 1) Nobody should add any instance methods on this. Instance methods can be
//    more difficult to predict when they get optimized and they are almost
//    never inlined properly in static compilers.
// 2) Nobody should rely on `instanceof Fiber` for type testing. We should
//    always know when it is a fiber.
// 3) We might want to experiment with using numeric keys since they are easier
//    to optimize in a non-JIT environment.
// 4) We can easily go from a constructor to a createFiber object literal if that
//    is faster.
// 5) It should be easy to port this to a C struct and keep a C implementation
//    compatible.
